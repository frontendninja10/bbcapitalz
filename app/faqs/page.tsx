              What are the risks involved with the collective model?
            </AccordionTrigger>
            <AccordionContent>
              Yes, there are risks associated with the collective model,
              primarily related to the potential loss of funds. These risks can
              be categorized into two types: external risks and internal risks.
              To mitigate these risks, we require participants to only deposit
              an amount they are willing to lose, which should be no more than
              10% of their intended capital. Since the minimum deposit is $200,
              your 10% deposit must be at least $200. It&apos;s essential to
              understand these risks before proceeding. For a detailed
              explanation of the two types of risks, please refer to this link.
