              the 10% capital.

              However, it's important to note that trading involves inherent
              risks, and even though we employ stringent risk and money
              management strategies, there is no guarantee of profits or
              complete elimination of losses. We strive to strike a balance
              between capital growth and risk control, and our experienced team
              of traders diligently follow risk and money management protocols
              to minimize the risk on your investments.
